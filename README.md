# customer_satisfaction_prediction_final_project
**Summary of the project**:

1. The goal was to predict customer satisfaction levels using historical customer data.
2. The dataset was loaded and inspected for structure, data types, and missing values.
3. Missing values were dropped, and categorical features were label encoded.
4. Features were separated from the target column ("Satisfaction") for modeling.
5. The data was scaled and split into training and testing sets (80-20 split).
6. A Random Forest Classifier was trained on the training data.
7. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
8. The model achieved a high accuracy (based on your output).
9. Two key visuals were used: satisfaction distribution and confusion matrix.
10. Final predictions and cleaned data were saved for further use.
